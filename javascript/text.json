  "When I'm not doing university work, I like to go to my local DW gym in Leicester town center, just outside of the ever-stuffy Highcross shopping center. 
  When it comes to education and my working life, it hasn't always been a straight path. I left high school after completing my GCSE's and did a BTEC in ICT at Tamworth college. I failed first year and had to retake some modules during second year at a different college: Burton and South Staffordshite college. After that, I joined the Army in the hope of becoming a chef in the Royal Logistics Corp."
 However, after a few months, I decided that the Army wasn't for me, despite my enjoyment of most of what we did there. I began to have thoughts of university and getting back into IT related stuff; which led to me taking and completing a Foundation in Computing at De Montfort University. This, for me, naturally led to the BsC Computing course at the same university, of which I am now a third year student!
