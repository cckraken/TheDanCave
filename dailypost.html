	<h2>Basil Brush on The Chase</h2>
	</header>
   <p>Welcome to the Dan Cave. This is a personal website used by myself
	   in order to document my experiences at university, among other things.
	   Feel free to look around.

	<h2>My recent ailments</h2>
	</header>
   <p>I developed tonsillitis again around a month ago. It basically renders me unable to do anything other than feel sorry for myself and try not to die as I swallow small amounts of water and dairy products. A few weeks after that my body decided to catch a cold. Excellent!

	<h2>Website Development</h2>
	</header>
   <p>After catching up on most of the work I fell behind in during my recent spout of illnesses, development on my website project has finally begun, which I'm pretty pleased about. Hopefully the lack of commits thus far will not go overly punished. :^)

	<h2>Christmas!</h2>
	</header>
   <p>It's almost Christmas! Again! I was unluckily sick on Christmas day last year and briefly lost my sense of taste as a result. Not having to deal with that this year would be nice, so here's hoping my awful immune system can come through for me.
