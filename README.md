## 1.) Choice of websiteand why

I inititally wanted to create a personal website that would also act 
as a portfolio site for myself, but ran out of time due to illness and 
could fully implement all of the functionality that I wanted to. Despite
 this, I am relatively pleased with what I have accomplished. Site looks
 nice on desktops and decent on tablets/mobiles.

## 2.) Wireframe/Initial designs

Initial designs of my site can be found below. As mentioned above, a few of them are very different to what I ended up developing.

## 3.) HTML5 semantic elements

I often find Div elements easier to style and manage compared to semantic HTML5 elements, but I included as much as I could, wherever appopriate.

Often times this involsves semantic elements with a div container, as shows in the first and second picture.

Or completely HTML5 semantic, as shown below.

## 4.) Creative CSS3 usage


## 5.) JS implementation


## 6.) Reflection

Once I got over my illness and got back on track with my other 
assignments, I really enjoyed developing this website. I learned a lot 
on the way which is why some of my basic paper designs are quite 
different to what I ended up doing. This is because I found better ways 
to display what I wanted to display, at least when it came to JavaScript
 (which I had to learn as I did it) and desktop views.
