## 1.) Choice of websiteand why

I inititally wanted to create a personal website that would also act 
as a portfolio site for myself, but ran out of time due to illness and 
could fully implement all of the functionality that I wanted to. Despite
 this, I am relatively pleased with what I have accomplished. Site looks
 nice on desktops and decent on tablets/mobiles.

## 2.) Wireframe/Initial designs

Initial designs of my site can be found below. As mentioned above, a few of them are very different to what I ended up developing.

## 3.) HTML5 semantic elements

I often find Div elements easier to style and manage compared to semantic HTML5 elements, but I included as much as I could, wherever appopriate.

Often times this involsves semantic elements with a div container, as shows in the first and second picture.

Or completely HTML5 semantic, as shown below.

## 4.) Creative CSS3 usage
I'm quite pleased with my CSS3 development. I've learned a lot about styling, especially navigation and image grouping using flexbox. Below are some examples.

## 5.) JS implementation
When it came to using JavaScript, I had to choose between just adding JS functionality for the sake of it, or adding functionality that actually benefits the site and has a clear purpose. I chose the latter. Below are some examples.

### 6.) Reflection

## Overall
Once I got over my illness and got back on track with my other 
assignments, I really enjoyed developing this website. I learned a lot 
on the way which is why some of my basic paper designs are quite 
different to what I ended up doing. This is because I found better ways 
to display what I wanted to display, at least when it came to JavaScript
 (which I had to learn as I did it) and desktop views.
 
 ## HTML
 Web development has never been my strong point. Despite this, I've improved my understanding quite a lot since starting this project. Unfortunately most of that understanding came in with only a few days before the assessment deadline, but I can use the skills I've learnt here in the future.
 
 ## CSS
 If web development assessments have taught me one thing; it's that I am not much of a creative person. I sometimes struggle to find inspiriation for cool and functional styling, but despite this, I have still learned a good deal.
 
 ## JavaScript
 As mentioned above, I chose to add JS functionality that would benefit the site rather than dump JS all over the place and hope for extra marks. Still, I am quite pleased with what I managed.
 
 ## Known issues for future development
 - Fix image pathing on index
 - Better resizing of elements and responsiveness for mobile
 - Fix responsivement for tablets
 - Improve CSS coding; combining similar elements, learning new transitions etc
