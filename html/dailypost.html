	<h2>Basil Brush on The Chase</h2>
	</header>
   <p>I usually forget about the often weekly celebrity edition of the chase. Who do I find on there when I load it up? Basil Brush.
   Yep: Basil Brush.
   It brought back memories of when I'd come home from school and watch the Basil Brush show with a cup of tea. Good times.

	<h2>My recent ailments</h2>
	</header>
   <p>I developed tonsillitis again around a month ago. It basically renders me unable to do anything other than feel sorry for myself and try not to die as I swallow small amounts of water and dairy products. A few weeks after that my body decided to catch a cold. Excellent!

	<h2>Website Development</h2>
	</header>
   <p>After catching up on most of the work I fell behind in during my recent spout of illnesses, development on my website project has finally begun, which I'm pretty pleased about. Hopefully the lack of commits thus far will not go overly punished. :^)

	<h2>Christmas!</h2>
	</header>
   <p>It's almost Christmas! Again! I was unluckily sick on Christmas day last year and briefly lost my sense of taste as a result. Not having to deal with that this year would be nice, so here's hoping my awful immune system can come through for me.
